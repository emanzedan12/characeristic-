            <p>People should develop basic personality characteristics, values, beliefs, interests,dreams, and habits by their late teens and early twenties.  For most people these personal attributes seem to remain relatively fixed throughout their lives. However, other people are more actively changing and evolving throughout their lives, constantly learning and seeking new experiences, and constantly growing and seeking higher levels of living.  Do you know people who fit in both categories? How else are they different? .</p>
